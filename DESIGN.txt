MACHINE DESIGN, BRIEFLY:
    - one special table for string literals:
        - 8 bytes for the number of string literals
        - subsequently, for each entry:
            - 8 bytes for the string size without nul byte
            - The rest of the string
            - NUL padding to align to 8 bytes
            - 8 bytes for -1 refcount
    - instruction section:
        - 8 bytes for the number of instructions
        - some multiple of 8 bytes for each subsequent opcode, consisting of:
            - 6 bytes for the instruction
            - two 4-bit bitfields counting from LSB:
                - register argument flags (set iff the argument is in a register)
                - type flags (set if the argument is a string/empty)
            - 1 byte for the number of arguments (unsigned)
            - 8 bytes for each subsequent argument
    - NOTE: for type tags, 1 represents string/empty; if value is 0 then empty;
      this means that the string table is one-indexed

    - Dynamically-created strings will be refcounted. The structure is the same as
      that of string literals, but there will be 8 extra bytes after to hold the
      refcount. REFCOUNT FOR STRING LITERALS SHOULD BE -1.
